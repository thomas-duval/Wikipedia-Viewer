# Wikipedia-Viewer
1.   Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/pgNRvJ.
2.   Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
3.   Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
4.   User Story: I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
5.   User Story: I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.
6.   Hint #1: Here's a URL you can use to get a random Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random.
7.   Hint #2: Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page.
8.   Hint #3: Use this link to experiment with Wikipedia's API.
9.   Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
10.   When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.
